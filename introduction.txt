1.  Why to use BINARY FILE instead of TEXT FILE?
=>  Text files will convert each digit in data into  ASCII  format which will take more space compared to required one,
    It saves the memory by storing any data as per its memory size

2.  Does fopen & fclose act same in text file & binary file?
=>  YES

3.  What is job of fread?
=> fread takes 4 arguments ->
    a) memory address to read into
    b) memory size to read
    c) number of blocks to read
    d) file from which we will read

4.  fwrite?
=>  fwrite works same but moves block of bytes from memory to file

5.  fseek?
=>  moves the file pointer to byte in file

6.  SEEK_SET SEEK_CUR SEEK_END?
=>  SEEK_SET - moves x byte down from beginning 
    SEEK_CUR - moves x byte down from current position
    SEEK_END - moves x byte down from end of file
